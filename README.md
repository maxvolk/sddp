# Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming

This repository is a work in progress and aims at an implementation of Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming for Multi-Stage Stochastic Linear Programs.
In particular the extension including batch learning via incorporation of experience replay will be implemented.
